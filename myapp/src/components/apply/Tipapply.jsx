                                <p className='mt-4'>Even if you have set a clear goal that you want to be a student at a certain university, it is always best and wise to apply to at least three universities, even if they are in different locations abroad.</p>
                                <h2 className='mt-4'>2. Be realistic and informed</h2>
                                <p className='mt-4'>Check and read the academic requirements carefully to figure out the probability of being accepted by the university. If you donâ€™t have a clear idea about the requirements, you can contact the department of international students or an adviser from the university.</p>

                                <h2 className='mt-4'>3. Discover how you can apply</h2>
                                <p className='mt-4'>Usually, you can apply through the website of the university directly and submit all the required documents or send them by post. In some countries, you can apply through a specific online platform that is easier to use and also gives you the possibility to apply to more universities at once.</p>
                                <h2 className='mt-4'>4. Be careful with the paperwork</h2>
                                <p className='mt-4'>All documents have to be translated into the official language of the respective country and legally authenticated by a competent authority. This means an official stamp could stand between you and your degree.</p>
