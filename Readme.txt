Heyy User 
Welcome......
-> you can download this ICC(International College Consultancy project) which is created using REACT-JS and NODE-JS 

-> And also admin panel is not done yet but i am working on it..

-> Firstly, you should create reg database in phpmyadmin and then import reg(2).sql database in phpmyadmin.
and then open this project in VS code and next step is, open terminal and first go into myapp folder (just write "cd myapp") and then run npm start

-> And then open terminal again and go into server folder (just write cd. server) and to start the server you should write npm start then your project is ready in your browser( also note this you have to start xampp server)
